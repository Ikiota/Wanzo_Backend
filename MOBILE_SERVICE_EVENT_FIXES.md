# App Mobile Service TypeScript Error Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix TypeScript errors in the app_mobile_service module that were preventing successful Docker builds.

## Overview of Issues

1. Missing or incorrect exports in shared event types:
   - `UserCreatedEventData` not exported (only `UserCreatedEvent` was available)
   - `TokenTransactionEvent` not defined or exported
   - Wrong enum usage (`UserEventTopics` was used instead of `SubscriptionEventTopics` for subscription events)
   - Field name mismatches in interfaces (e.g., `status` vs `newStatus`, `expiresAt` vs `endDate`)
   - Missing dependency: `@nestjs/schedule` package not installed

2. Type conflicts:
   - Date vs string incompatibilities (timestamps were handled inconsistently)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created and Fixed Event Type Definitions

- Added `TokenTransactionEvent` interface in a new `token-events.ts` file
- Created a proper export for `TokenEventTopics` enum
- Added `UserCreatedEventData` interface as an alias for `UserCreatedEvent` for backward compatibility

### 2. Fixed Import References

- Updated imports in subscription-events.consumer.ts to use `SubscriptionEventTopics` instead of `UserEventTopics`
- Updated token-events.consumer.ts to use `TokenEventTopics` instead of `UserEventTopics`
- Properly re-exported all event types from kafka-config.ts

### 3. Resolved Field Name Inconsistencies

- Updated references to match the actual interface definitions:
  - Used `newStatus` instead of `status`
  - Used `endDate` instead of `expiresAt`

### 4. Fixed Date vs String Type Conflicts

- Added conversion from string to Date:
  ```typescript
  user.updatedAt = new Date(event.timestamp);
  ```
- Added conversion from Date to string:
  ```typescript
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  ```

### 5. Installed Missing Dependencies

- Added `@nestjs/schedule` to package.json

## Future Improvements

1. Consider standardizing timestamp handling across all events:
   - Either consistently use string ISO format
   - Or consistently use Date objects and convert at boundaries

2. Improve TypeScript typing in event handlers:
   - Add more specific types for event payloads
   - Use strict typing for event fields

3. Create better documentation for event schemas:
   - Document the structure of all events
   - Document which services produce/consume which events

## Testing

The fixes were implemented and tested by:
1. Installing the updated dependencies
2. Fixing all TypeScript errors
3. Rebuilding the Docker containers

These changes ensure that the app_mobile_service Docker build completes successfully.
